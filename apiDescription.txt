api problem

We have a system that allows both an REST API and web application. In the system, there are users, products, purchase orders and entitlements.

A user can buy an entitlement by placing a purchase order for the product they want to buy.

A purchase order requires the following information in order to complete a purchase:

user
product(s) to buy
payment (credit card)
There exists an API to add, find, and update users and products.

There exists an API to accept purchase orders. If a purchase is successful, the user receives their entitlement.

There exists an API to find entitlements.

The web application also provides the same functionality as the API.

Your goal is to create a test suite for this system. What would you test?
